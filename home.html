	 <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
      <p>After living in the United States for over a decade, we realized that our community was lacking any bakery that provided Filipino pastries. Pandesal bakery was founded with a vision: to provide hand-crafted Filipino-American fare in an inviting and inclusive environment.  Using the freshest and finest local ingredients, we strike the delicate balance between the two cultures in our signature dishes. Our baked goods are made fresh daily with traditional recipes passed down and innovated through generations. We hope to offer an option for every preference - whether that be a savory sandwich with an iced latte or sweet roll with a cup of our finest drip coffee. Our cozy bistro area offers ample seating for casual dining, focused work, or community meetings. We aim to provide a space for commune, for sustenance, for fuel and for culture. </p>
      <h3>What is PANDESAL?</h3>
      <p>Our signature baked good and best-selling item is the traditional Filipino pandesal or pan de sal (salt bread). Made from simple ingredients, flour, eggs, yeast, sugar and salt, the key to this bread is in the bake. With a golden exterior and fluffy interior structure, pandesal is an irresistible breakfast pastry. Due to its simple flavor composition, pandesal can be accompanied with a wide variety of spreads, both savory and sweet. Here at Pandesal Bakery, our favorite way to eat the delicacy will always be the simplest: dunked into hot cup of coffee. </p>
